Druid-Squid-GUID Generator
=========================

This program does three things:

Prints out an ASCII art representation of a druid.
Prints out an ASCII art representation of a squid.
Prints out a version 4 UUID in hex form.

Why?
=========================

I'm not quite sure how to pronounce 'GUID'.

Who?
=========================

[Nolan Caudill](http://nolancaudill.com)

How?
=========================

With code. The squid came from [here](http://www.retrojunkie.com/asciiart/animals/squid.htm) and the [druid](http://ascii.co.uk/art/druid) came from here.
